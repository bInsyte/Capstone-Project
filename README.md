I have a final Pivot Table I am looking to create and am not sure how to approach it or implement it. I am looking to create a 'Shared Routes' table that will include the top ten most shared routes among member/casual users. I am not sure how I could begin to extract that information from the source data. Perhaps something like an SQL query would be the best way to do so.
