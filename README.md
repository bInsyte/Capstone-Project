I have a final Pivot Table I am looking to create and am not sure how to approach it or implement it. I am looking to (initially) extract the necessary data either via SQL query or through a R code. My databse currently has around 22,000 rows of data with 380,000 datapoints. 

I want to extract the most commonly shared route_taken amoing casual and member users. Data should be categorized by the top ten most popular shared routes, what the avg_ride time was for that shared_route, and how many/which bike_type was used for each route and the avg_ride times for either classic/electric bike_types.

Let me know how we can do this!
